# Welcome to UDL documentation site

This page serves to demonstrate and document new UDL 2.1.

UDL stands for **User Defined Language**, it is a feature of [Notepad++ editor](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) through which users can define their own syntax highlighting.

Also, please note that this is documentation site only, source code is available at [official Notepad++ github page](https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus)

Thank you and best regards,<br>
Ivan RadiÄ‡

Welcome to UDL documentation site
=================================

This page serves to demonstrate and document new UDL 2.1.    
UDL stands for **U**ser **D**efined **L**anguage, it is a feature of 
[Notepad++ editor](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) through 
which users can define their own syntax highlighting.

UDL 2.1 is my attempt to update default UDL that is shipped with Notepad++.    

Also, please note that this is documentation site only, source code is avialable at 
[official Notepad++ github page](https://github.com/donho/notepad-plus-plus)

Thank you and best regards,    
Ivan RadiÄ‡
